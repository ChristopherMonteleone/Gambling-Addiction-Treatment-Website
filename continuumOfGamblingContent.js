<p>Gambling activities span along a continuum from no gambling to disordered gambling. In
determining where someone might be along this spectrum, it can be helpful to understand
some of the characteristics associated with different points along the continuum.</p>
<p>Below, several classifications of gambling behavior are placed along a continuum and their
associated features are described based on some existing literature. To begin with, watch a video
by Dr. Reid where he discusses the continuum and ways to think about it.</p>

<p>This continuum is one of many tools' gamblers can use to evaluate their gambling. It
provides an overview that can help classify gambling behavior. If gambling is believed to fall
in an at-risk category, individuals should consider speaking with a counselor to receive
some objective feedback and suggestions about possible changes that might be helpful.</p>
