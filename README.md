## Client-side routing
The navigation links now use clean, path-based URLs that are handled by a client-side router. When deploying to Apache-compatible hosting, include the provided `.htaccess` file so requests to routes like `/OurMission` or `/Resources/AudioAndVideoLibrary` are rewritten to `index.html` for proper rendering.

## Contact updates
The header call-to-action highlights the intake scheduling line at **(702) 900-1460**. Update this number in `index.html` if the intake contact changes.
