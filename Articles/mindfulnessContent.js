<p><b>Mindfulness Approaches to Problem Gambling Recovery</b></p>
<p>Mindfulness appears to be emerging everywhere these days - for stress reduction,
anxiety, and overall quality of life - <i>but for gambling addictions?</i> The short answer is
yes. In fact, addiction counselors and therapists are integrating mindfulness in problem
gambling treatment all around the world with promising results. </p>
<p>Practicing mindfulness will help you learn how to respond rather than react to situations
that might otherwise trigger problem gambling. It can help you learn how to interrupt the
many automatic responses you've developed to challenges by teaching you how to slow
down, consider your options, and respond in a more thoughtful way. </p>
<p>The main strategy used to cultivate mindfulness is meditation, and although several
meditation techniques have their origins in Buddhist spiritual philosophies,
contemporary psychology has focused on mindfulness-based clinical applications for a
variety of mental health issues associated with distress and emotional suffering. Since
many people with addictions also have co-occurring mental health problems, it makes
sense that mindfulness interventions are also being explored in the field of addictions
with some promising results, as noted in a separate article authored by Dr. Judson
Brewer at Harvard. </p>
<p>Now, emerging research suggests mindfulness meditation may be useful to help
individuals with gambling addictions to increase tolerance for cravings, enhance stress
coping, and improve their ability to manage unpleasant emotions. Some have also
offered that mindfulness can help reduce impulsivity, a common contributing factor to
problem gambling and relapse in recovery.</p>

<p><b>What is Mindfulness?</b></p>
<p>Mindfulness is typically defined as the process of bringing awareness and non-
judgmental acceptance to one's present moment experience of thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations. Essentially,
mindfulness consists of two
components.1 First, it involves
the self-regulation of attention,
so it is directed and maintained
on the immediate experience
(including unpleasant emotions,
addictive cravings, or whatever
else may arise at a given
moment). This is why a lot of
mindfulness meditation is dedicated to simple exercises, such as focusing and
sustaining attention on something like our breathing. Patients will often report this is
much more difficult than they expect. In part, this is because our minds have a tendency
to wander off and entertain a great deal of "chatter" - thoughts, memories, experiences,
or various worries about unfinished tasks. It can be a real strain just to learn how to
focus and regulate our attention. This is why we practice, so we can cultivate a better
ability to "attend" and as part of this process, we also increase our awareness of things
that may historically have gone unnoticed. For instance, someone may begin to
appreciate small things in life for which they are grateful or discover aspects about
themselves that were previously outside of consciousness. This in turn, can significantly
enhance the depth and breadth of our life experience.</p>
<p>The second component of mindfulness entails adopting an orientation towards one's
present experience characterized by openness, curiosity, and acceptance. That means
we don't pass judgment on the various experiences that arise in any given moment.
Consider the application of this principle in the wake of an addictive craving. Historically,
problem gamblers frequently get into a tug-of-war with their cravings and approach such
cravings with an "I have to slay the dragon" mentality. In part, this is because the
cravings are judged as "bad" or "problematic." Yet the cravings are simply a
physiological and psychological experience that is neither good nor bad. A mindfulness
approach doesn't give the experience special status or indulge the craving, but we don't
ignore or avoid the craving either. In mindfulness, we simply pay attention with curiosity
to how we experience the craving, the bodily-felt sensations that accompany such
cravings, in a non-judgmental manner. Being mindful is about recreating a new
relationship with the craving that allows it some space to co-exist with the self. If the
craving feels too intense, we can take a break from it by focusing our attention for a
short period on something neutral like the breath. When we are ready, attention is
refocused in being present with the craving again. As part of this practice, various
thoughts will arise and in mindfulness we just note such thoughts rather than getting
wrapped up in them. A thought is just a thought, not a fact!</p>
<p>This is what mindfulness is about. Being present in the moment with an experience,
rather than getting caught up with the stories we often tell ourselves about what the
experiences should mean (e.g. this craving is too difficult, I can't handle it, etc.). With
problem gamblers, the practice of mindfulness teaches individuals to "lean into
experiences" rather than avoid them by turning to one's addiction.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Mindfulness Practice</b></p>
<p>Mindfulness is often cultivated through meditation practices. It's important not to get the
two confused. Often, people say that mindfulness is meditation. This would be like
saying taking a road-trip on a vacation is synonymous with just traveling in a car. While
a car is the vehicle through which one can visit a constellation of destinations and
attractions that contribute to the overall vacation experience, we would be amiss to limit
the description of a vacation to simply just riding in a car. Similarly, meditation exercises
are a vehicle that allows us to cultivate a wide array of mindful moments, experiences,
and increased levels of new awareness.</p>
<p>Several forms of meditation are taught in mindfulness-based approaches to
psychological treatment with gamblers and each have similarities in their procedures
and goals. An example of a typical meditation exercise may instruct a patient to sit
quietly, either cross-legged or on the floor, and focus attention on the sensations of
breathing. This might include the temperature of the air as it flows through our nostrils,
the rate, depth, or rhythm of breathing. Efforts to regulate the breath are discouraged as
mindfulness is about accepting whatever arises in the moment without trying to change
it in any way. As various thoughts might compete for attention, a patient is encouraged
to take note of them (e.g., a planning thought, a worrying thought, a judging thought)
and then let go of the thought while returning the focus of attention to the breath.
Throughout this process, patients cultivate the ability to observe incoming thoughts
without over-identifying with them or judging them (e.g., my thoughts are neither good
nor bad, they are just thoughts). Moreover, when a shift in self-awareness occurs,
patients are instructed to redirect focus back to the breath and away from distressing
thoughts or ruminations.</p>
<p>Patients are further encouraged to apply the concepts learned in meditation to activities
in their daily lives, including various thoughts, feelings, and cravings associated with
gambling behaviors. In essence, one goal of mindfulness is to help reorganize our
relationship with these experiences in such a way that we don't allow them to provoke
us in a way where we engage in self-destructive addictive behavior.</p>

<p>As you listen to Dr. Brewer consider how what you learn might help with problem gambling behavior.</p>
<p><b>Mindfulness and Gambling Disorders</b></p>
<p>Dr. Reid and his colleagues at UCLA have conducted research showing increased
levels of mindfulness are linked to a reduction in tendencies to engage in problem
gambling and the host of distressing emotions often encountered by those with
gambling disorders. Other studies have found evidence that cognitive behavioral
therapy when combined with a mindfulness intervention can reduce gambling severity.
Thus, those with gambling disorders should consider participation in mindfulness
training as part of their recovery process. As with most things, proficient mindful practice
requires an investment of effort and energy. However, sobriety in recovery is about
commitment and dedication to worthwhile activities that can facilitate the process of
positive change. Mindfulness appears to be one of these meaningful activities leading to
powerful experiences for those with a gambling addiction.</p>

<p>In the video by Dr. Reid, you had an opportunity to practice some mindfulness meditation exercises. What was your initial reaction to these exercises? Can you imagine how a regular practice of mindfulness can help you in the ways discussed?</p>
<p><b>Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention</b></p>
<p>Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) is a treatment for preventing relapse in
addictive disorders that integrates mindfulness meditation with standard relapse
prevention practices typically associated with behavioral therapies. It was developed at
the Addictive Behaviors Research Center at the University of Washington by the late Dr.
Alan Marlatt and his colleagues to help people in their recovery from addictive
behaviors. The primary goals for MBRP are:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 20px;">
    <li style="padding: 0px;"><p>Help develop awareness of personal triggers and habitual reactions and learn
    ways to create a pause in this seemingly automatic process that contributes to
    addictions.</p></li>
    <li style="padding: 0px;"><p>Help people with addictions change their relationship to discomfort, learning to
    recognize challenging emotional and physical experiences and responding to
    them in skillful ways.</p></li>
    <li style="padding: 0px;"><p>Help foster a nonjudgmental, compassionate approach toward ourselves
    and our experiences.</p></li>
    <li style="padding: 0px;"><p>Help people with addictions build a lifestyle that supports both mindfulness
    practice and recovery.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>They have several free audio exercises for individuals struggling with addiction that you
can try out for free on their MBRP website.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Summary</p>
<p>Mindfulness approaches to problem gambling have shown promise in helping
individuals reduce, control, or stop gambling behaviors. Mindfulness has been used by
the healthcare community over the past 20 years to help alleviate suffering with a wide
variety of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, trauma, and
addictive behaviors. Mindfulness can help problem gamblers 1) increase tolerance for
uncomfortable feelings, 2) cope more effectively with stress, 3) reorganize their
relationships with gambling cravings, 4) enhance their ability to regulate attention, and
5) reduce impulsivity.</p>
<p>Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention is a specific approach to helping individuals in
addiction recovery incorporate mindfulness principles. Many of the MBRP exercises
target helping people cope with various addictive cravings and other challenges that
increase relapse.</p>
<p>Research has shown that people who practice mindfulness consistently experience
brain changes that are associated with a reduction in their problematic behaviors.</p>
